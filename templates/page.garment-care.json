Use a cotton garment bag to store your items in (do not use a plastic bag). And please avoid prolonged exposure to sun- or artificial light as this might cause discolaration. <br\/><br\/><br\/><strong>SHEARLINGS:<\/strong> <br\/>Please always store your shearling items hanging and in cotton garment bag. Before wearing your shearling, we recommend that you treat it with a water-repellent spray. Spray it at around 30cm from the jacket on the fabric, and let it airdry after (preferably outside). When sprayed in, shearling can handle rain and snow quite well. If your coat unexpectedly becomes really wet, please shake off the excess water and blot dry with a clean towel. <br\/><br\/><br\/><strong>TROUSERS:<\/strong><br\/>Please always store your trousers hanging to prevent wrinkels. <br\/><br\/><\/p><p><strong>WOOL:<\/strong><br\/>We use a premium quality blend that is made from 80 percent pure wool. Our pieces are made from a double-faced wool that required a particular finishing technique only possible through hand stitching. Make sure that wool items are clean and do not have food stains or body oils when storing them away, to prevent moths. Always store your wool jackets hanging on a sturdy clothing hanger. <\/p>",

Small amount of liquid detergent:<br\/>Liquid detergents dissolve better than powders and are the most sensitive option for hand or machine washing. Use a very small amount of soft liquid detergent or liquid baby shampoo and pour it into the drawer of the machine (not directly into the drum). <br\/><br\/>4.
