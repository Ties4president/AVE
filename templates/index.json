Pets were coming in with stiff hips and joints, skin, coat and digestion issues and an overall lack of energy. He recognized that commercially processed kibble was not providing the nutrition needed for pets to thrive and thus created The Missing Link superfood supplements.<\/p><p>Since then food has come a long way, but the need for additional support is still very much needed. In honor of our founder, we continue to pioneer fresh, high-quality and effective solutions for a range of health needs your pet may have.<\/p>",
